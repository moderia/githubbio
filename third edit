Hello, my name is Mohamed Deria. 
Iâ€™m a young & motivated professional who is currently training in the quality assurance track at an internship program called yearup. 
Prior to joining this amazing program, I was a full-time college student studying to get my BA in civil engineering.
I also worked as a direct support professional at a nonprofit organization that helps vulnerable adults with mental disabilities.
